# Developer-Fact-Quiz-Game

This program is an input/output console application I programmed in C++ using Visual Studio as my IDE. The game asks the user a series of five (5) questions about me and detects if the inputed integer value matches the integer value associated with the correct response. If the correct asnwer was selected, the user gets to continue the quiz. If an incorrect answer was seleted, the user is informed and the quiz is over. If the user answers all five (5) questions correctly, they win and the application congratulates them.

This is the first version of this program. I will make version 2 which will provide facts about the correct answer when the correct answer is chosen ðŸ¤“
